<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
Heresy: A deliberate deviation from the orthodox doctrine.
SQLTags (<a href="http://www.sqltags.org">http://sqltags.org</a>) is, indeed, a deliberate deviation from the orthodoxy of the Model-View-Control (MVC) design pattern; 
therefore, SQLTags is heresy, but is it necessarily "bad?" 
In this article, I will introduce the SQLTags toolkit and when it can be successfully employed.
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding the recent criticism by N. Alex Rupp in <a href="http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2003/12/11/mvc.html">Beyond MVC</a>, 
the MVC design pattern is, currently, the gold standard for highly complex web applications developed within the Servlet environment.  
Just subscribe to any of the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/struts/using.html#Lists">Struts mailing lists</a> to witness how vibrant 
this community is.  
However, as stated on the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/struts/index.html">Struts main page</a> and paraphrased here, Struts and, 
by extension, MVC are not the best choice for every project.  
The Struts community asserts that only "very simply applications, with a handful of pages," are candidates for non-MVC implementations, 
and with this I agree; however, the threshold of "very simple" has been changed by the introduction of SQLTags.  
</p>

<!-- co: I rephrased this to get rid of all the bold "a tag"s.  our rhetorical
    style is usually more subtle.  ca -->
<p>
SQLTags implements a very simple concept:  
<i>Database schema as Tag Library</i>. Each table is represented as a JSP tag, a tag that:
</p>

<ul>
     <li>"knows" all of the columns</li>
     <li>"knows" how to automatically assign HTTP request parameters to those columns</li>
     <li>"knows" its own primary key and uses it in update and delete statements</li>
     <li>"knows" all of its imported and exported foreign keys and, more importantly, how to use them to join to the related tables</li>
     <li>"knows" how to write insert, update, delete, and select statements</li>
     <li>"knows" how to process several rows at once</li>
     <li>"knows" how to automatically output the results in pages</li>
</ul>

<p>
in short, a tag that "knows" the underlying table and how to integrate it into the Servlet environment.
</p>

<p>
This simple concept extends the realm of "very simple" to what was previously moderately complex, data-driven web applications.
</p>

<h3>SQLTags Features</h3>

<!-- co: added an earlier reference to the website, so the curious can see who
    it's from, verify that it's free / open-source, etc., before continuing.
    often we'd do this by just linking the first reference to SQLTags, but
    it's the last thing in your previous paragraph and I don't want to 
    bury it.  ca -->
<p>
SQLTags, available at <a href="http://www.sqltags.org/">www.sqltags.org</a>, is a free, open source, object-relational mapping toolkit that provides a new and innovative approach to data-driven web applications development.  
At the SQLTags core is a generator that builds a JavaBean and JSP tag for each table within a given JDBC schema.
The SQLTags Generator packages everything (including built-in tags and support classes) into a single Java Archive or "jar" file for easy deployment
into any Java 1.4/Servlet 2.3/JSP 1.2 (or later) J2EE Application Server.
Best of all, SQLTags is quick and easy to learn and understand.  
</p>

<!-- co: trimmed unnecessary "input that identifies". removed quotes from
    jar file (our readers know what jar files are and think of them as
    jars, not as an abbreviation for Java Archive, so the quotes are
    non-standard for us.)  ca -->
<p>
The SQLTags generator accepts a valid (and available) JDBC Driver, JDBC URL, user name, password, schema name, and other options 
which are used to reverse-engineer the given database schema into the corresponding jar file.
The resulting jar file can be deployed into any complaint Application Server.
On the target server, the "deployment descriptor" or <code>/WEB-INF/web.xml</code> file is updated to include "context parameters"
     that tell SQLTags how to connect to the same or an identical schema.
     Once the generated jar file is successfully deployed into the target Application Server,
     JSP pages can use the generated (and built-in) tags contained within the jar file to implement the desired functionality.
     Whenever the database is changed, simply use the SQLTags Generator to "re-generate" the jar file.
     </p>

     <p>
     Additionally, SQLTags works well with other Java and JSP industry standards like:
     </p>
     
     <ul>
	     <li><b>JavaBeans</b>:  each SQLTags tag is a JavaBean, </li>
	     <li><b>JSTL</b>:  SQLTags beans are easily accessible within JSTL's Expression Language (EL), </li>
	     <li><b>JSP 2.0</b>:  SQLTags tags are easily accessible using the "${" syntax, and</li>
	     <li><b>Struts</b>:  SQLTags tags work well with the Struts "html" tags.</li>
     </ul>

     <p>
     SQLTags is both application server and database independent. 
     </p>

     <h3>Functional Overview</h3>

     <p>
     There are three steps required to use a SQLTags generated jar file:  
     </p>
     <ol>
	     <li> run the generator to create the jar file, </li>
	     <li> deploy the generated jar file into the target web application</li>
	     <li> author JSP pages using the tags within the target web application.</li>
     </ol>

     <p>
     This section will provide an overview of the functionality available to the JSP developer when using a generated jar file.
     </p>

<!-- co: I changed the bold functionality headers to <h4>'s, which is more
    in line with our usual style.  This does make for a few one-paragraph
    sections, but I think it's OK, and since you bold your attributes and
    tag names, I think it's cleaner overall.  ca -->
     <h4>Built-in tags</h4>
     
<p>SQLTags adds a number of built-in tags to the generated jar file. 
     These can be broken down into three main categories:  
     </p>
     <ul>
	     <li> <b>paging support</b>:  <code>first</code>, <code>last</code>, <code>next</code>, and <code>previous</code>; </li>
	     <li> <b>database support</b>:  <code>connection</code>, <code>commit</code>, <code>rollback</code>, <code>exception</code>,
	          <code>cursor</code>, <code>statement</code>, <code>fetch</code>, <code>where</code>, and <code>orderby</code> </li>
	     <li> <b>authorization</b>:  <code>authorize</code>, <code>allow</code>, and <code>deny</code>. </li>
     </ul>

     <p>
     The most commonly used built-in tags are <code>connection</code>, <code>exception</code>, <code>where</code>, and <code>fetch</code>.  
     The <code>connection</code> tag is required in every page that needs a connection to the database (almost every page). 
     Connections can come from the built-in SQLTags connection pool defined within the "deployment descriptor" 
     or from a container-managed DataSource.  
     The <code>exception</code> tag outputs JDBC error messages only when things go awry with database operations.  
     The <code>where</code> and <code>fetch</code> tags are provided as a mechanism to more easily compose complex where clauses
     and explicitly iterate through the ResultSets.  
     The <code>cursor</code>, <code>statement,</code> and <code>fetch</code> tags are available to provide functionality similar to the
     JSTL "sql" tag library.  (At some point in the future, perhaps, SQLTags will integrate with the JSTL sql tag library.)
     </p>

     
     <h4>Generated tags</h4> 
     <p>As noted above, each table is represented as a tag and each of those tags have common attributes and methods
     as well as unique, per-column attributes and methods.  
     The common attributes available to all generated tags are: 
	<code>id</code>,
	<code>tableAlias</code>,
	<code>buttonName</code>,
	<code>columns</code>,
	<code>displaySize</code>,
	<code>foreignKey</code>,
	<code>handlerClass</code>,
	<code>hasFetch</code>,
	<code>maxRows</code>,
	<code>operation</code>,
	<code>orderBy</code>,
	<code>parentName</code>,
	<code>paging</code>,
	<code>preInsertSQL</code>,
	<code>preUpdateSQL</code>,
	<code>properties</code>,
	<code>startRowParameter</code>,
	<code>where</code>,
	and
	<code>from</code>.
     </p>

<!-- co: moved up this header since the copy below talks about these 
    generated attributes, so we want it all under the same header. ca -->
     <h4>Attributes</h4>
     <p>
     Additionally, for each column, <i>COL</i>, there are four generated tag attributes:  
     </p>

     <ul>
	     <li> <i>COL</i>, </li>
	     <li> <i>COL</i>_FORMAT, </li>
	     <li> <i>COL</i>_SELECT, and </li>
	     <li> <i>COL</i>_BIND. </li>
     </ul>

     
     <p>The "<i>COL</i>" attributes allow the value of the column to be explicitly set,
     <i>COL</i>_FORMAT provides a mechanism for specifying the display format for date and number columns,
     <i>COL</i>_SELECT provides a mechanism to override the select-list item for the column,
     and a <i>COL</i>_BIND provides a mechanism to override the bind expression used in a PreparedStatement 
     (every SQLTags SQL statement uses the PreparedStatement). 
     Some of the more commonly used attributes are:
     </p>

     <ul>
	     <li> <b>id</b>:  defines the snippet variable that can be used within JSP snippets or EL expressions;</li>
	     <li> <b>operation</b>:  defines an explicit operation to be carried out on the table (insert, update, delete, deleteChildren, or select);</li>
	     <li> <b>buttonName</b>:  defines a request parameter that contains the operation;</li>
	     <li> <b>foreignKey combined with parentName</b>:  used to nest tags in a parent-child configuration;</li>
	     <li> <b>paging="true" and displaySize</b>:  define paging behavior;</li>
	     <li> <b>properties="true"</b>:  tells the tag to scan the HTTP Request for parameter names that match column names;</li>
	     <li> <b>where</b>:  defines the where condition and causes the tag body to iterate once for each row that satisfies the given condition.</li>
     </ul>

     
     <h4>Methods</h4>
     <p>Some of the more useful methods available to all generated tags are:
     <code>insert()</code>, <code>update()</code>, <code>delete()</code>, and <code>delete(where)</code>.  
     Additionally, because each table tag is a JavaBean, each column, <i>COL</i>, has <code>set<i>COL</i>()</code> and <code>get<i>COL</i>()</code>
     methods and each foreign key, <i>FK</i>, has a <code>get<i>FK</i>()</code> method &#8212; again very useful for EL expressions.
     </p>


     <h4>Foreign Keys</h4>
     <p>SQLTags makes extensive use of foreign keys.
     Take a look at any Entity-Relationship Diagram, the glue that holds any database together is the foreign keys.
     Indeed, in my experience the majority of the navigation within a data-driven web application centers on the foreign keys,
     either through parent table lookups or through parent-child nesting.  
     For example, given an Employee, "what Department is she assigned to?"
     or given a Department "who are the Employees contained within it?" 
     or given an Invoice, list the Invoice Line Items and related Product Names.  
     These questions are all answered by foreign keys.
     </p>

<!-- co: moved the figure all the way up here because your reference to 
    it would be too far away otherwise.  besides, when the readers see it
    here and get used to it, you can just refer back to it later in the 
    section where it was originally located.  ca -->
     <p>
     SQLTags provides powerful ways to leverage foreign keys using "declarative access."
     For example, imagine two tables <code>EMP</code> and <code>DEPT</code> with a foreign key,
     <code>FK_DEPTNO</code>, defined within <code>EMP</code>
     referencing <code>DEPT</code>, as illustrated by Figure 1:</p>

     <p><img src="datamodel.jpg"/><br/>
        <i>Figure 1. Sample Datamodel</i></p>



     <p>When SQLTags generates our hypothetical <code>EMP</code> JavaBean,
     it would contain a <code>getFK_DEPTNO()</code> method that returns a <code>DEPT</code> JavaBean.
     Consider the following JSP 2.0 snippet.
     </p>

<pre><code>&lt;x:emp id="e" where="order by ENAME"&gt;
   ${e.ENAME} belongs to Department
   ${e.FK_DEPTNO.DNAME}!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/x:emp&gt;
</code></pre>

     <p>
     As expected, the column values are easily accessible using EL (beginning of second line)
     based on standard JavaBean syntax; 
     however and perhaps not expected, the foreign keys are also available in exactly the same way!  
     Need the Department name, <code>DNAME</code>, for a given Employee? 
     Simply use the foreign key <code>FK_DEPTNO</code> as the getter for the related Department. <i>Wow!</i>
     </p>

     <p>
     SQLTags also provides a mechanism for nesting children records within their parents, again, using foreign keys.
     Consider the following JSP 2.0 snippet.
     </p>

<pre><code>&lt;x:dept id="d" where="order by DNAME"&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;${d.DNAME} has the following employees:
   &lt;x:emp id="e" foreignKey="FK_DEPTNO"
                 parentName="d"&gt;
      ${e.ENAME}
  &lt;/x:emp&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/x:dept&gt;
</code></pre>

     <p>
     Again, note how easily the list of Employees for a given Department can be obtained simply by knowing 
     the foreign key name and the <code>"id"</code> of the <code>DEPT</code> tag.
     </p>

     <p>
     Finally, consider how simple it is for a programmer
     (or even a designer, heaven forbid) to look at an Entity-Relationship Diagram
     and start connecting the dots.
     </p>

     <h3>Running the SQLTags Generator</h3>

     <p>
     Download the <code>sqltags-1-0-6.war</code> (or latest version) web application file from the SQLTags web site at
     <a href="http://sqltags.org/downloads.jsp">http://sqltags.org/downloads.jsp</a> and deploy it into your favorite J2EE Application Server.  
     <i>Note: SQLTags requires Java 1.4, Servlet 2.3 or later, JSP 1.2 or later
	     and a suitable JDBC driver for your specific database.</i>
     The SQLTags web application comes with pre-installed JDBC drivers for Oracle, MySQL, and Sybase.  
     The JDBC Driver for Microsoft SQL Server is also included but is in the 
     <code>/WEB-INF/extras</code> directory and must be manually moved into
     <code>/WEB-INF/lib</code> in order to access a SQL Server database.
     </p>

     <p>
     <i><b>Note</b>: the <code>javac</code> executable must be accessible via the PATH variable (by the application server) 
	     in order to compile the generated JavaBean classes.</i>
     </p>
     
     <p>
     To deploy the <code>sqltags-1-0-6.war</code> file into the Tomcat Application Server,
     for example, simply copy the "war" file into the <code>CATALINA_HOME/webapps</code> directory,
     restart the server,
     and access the <code>/sqltags-1-0-6/</code> URI on your deployment host using your browser.  
     For example, if you were running Tomcat on your local workstation on port 8080 you would use the following URL to run the SQLTags web application:
     <code>http://localhost:8080/sqltags-1-0-6/</code> 
     The SQLTags web application contains information and samples for running the generator, deploying the jar files, and building JSP pages.
     </p>

     <p>
     To execute the generator from your browser,
     simply click on the <code>"run ..."</code> link near the top of the page
     (using the above example, the URL would be <code>http://localhost:8080/sqltags-1-0-6/generate.jsp</code>).
     Fill-in all the fields and click on the <code>"Generate!"</code> button.  
     That's it, really!
     </p>

     <p>
     The generate screen contains detailed descriptions for each input field.
     Basically, you'll need to specify:
     </p>

     <ul>
	     <li> the JDBC Driver and URL, </li>
	     <li> the database user name and password,</li>
	     <li> the JDBC Schema name,</li>
	     <li> a Java package for the generated Java code,</li>
	     <li> a jar file name, and </li> 
	     <li> flags to control inclusion of the built-in tags and source code.</li>
     </ul>

     <p>
     Once the generator completes, you should see output in the browser window showing that each table was processed.
     The generated jar file is saved into the <code>/WEB-INF/tmp</code> directory using the file name specified in the "JAR Filename" input field.
     <i>Note: future releases of SQLTags will likely place the generated jar file in the /tmp directory under the web application.</i>
     </p>

     <p>
     <i><b>Note</b>: SQLTags will not generate foreign key references to tables that are either not contained within the generated jar 
	     file due to wildcard exclusion or do not have a primary key.</i>
     </p>

     <h3>Deploying a Generated Tag Library</h3>

     <p>
     Deployment of the generated jar file is accomplished in two steps:  
     </p>

     <ol>
	     <li> copy the generated jar file into the <code>/WEB-INF/lib</code> directory of the target web application and </li>
	     <li> modify the <code>/WEB-INF/web.xml</code> (deployment descriptor) to define the SQLTags "context parameters." </li>
     </ol>

     <p>
     You'll likely need to restart the web application for the changes to take effect.
     </p>

     
     <h4>Context Parameters</h4>
     <p>Context parameters are added to the <code>/WEB-INF/web.xml</code> deployment descriptor immediately after the &lt;web-app&gt; tag using the following syntax. 
     </p>

<pre><code>&lt;context-param&gt;
  &lt;param-name&gt;SQLTags.useCM&lt;/param-name&gt;
  &lt;param-value&gt;true&lt;/param-value&gt;
&lt;/context-param&gt;
</code></pre>

     <p>
     The list of SQLTags context parameters is as follows:
     </p>


<!-- co: cleaned up syntax, clarity on these items a little. ca -->
     <ul>
	     <li><b><code>SQLTags.useCM</code></b>: Short for "use internal Connection Manager".  Valid values are <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.
	     When <code>false</code> SQLTags will use a DataSource and ignore the other SQLTags JDBC context parameters (listed below).
	     <!-- <br/><br/> -->
	     </li>

	     <li><b><code>SQLTags.dataSource</code></b>: Identifies the default <code>dataSource</code> to be used by the <code>ConnectionTag</code>
	     when no <code>dataSource</code> attribute is supplied and <code>useCM</code> is <code>false</code>; default value is <code>jdbc/SQLTagsDS</code>. 
	     <B>Note</b>: a DataSource is used when <code>useCM</code> is <code>false</code> or when a <code>connectionTag</code> explicitly references a 
		     <code>dataSource</code> from the <code>dataSource</code> attribute.
	     </li>

	     <li><b><code>SQLTags.bindStrings</code></b>: Should almost always be set of <code>false</code>; when <code>true</code> all database
	     bindings are processed as strings,
	     when <code>false</code> all numerical and date data types are processed as the correct native Java type.
	     Greatly helps with compatibility among different databases. 
	     </li>
     </ul>

     <p>
     The following parameters are only used when <code>SQLTags.useCM</code> is <code>true</code>.
     When <code>useCM</code> is <code>false</code> the JDBC parameters are defined externally within a <code>DataSource</code>.
     </p>

     <ul>

	     <li><b><code>SQLTags.databaseDriver</code></b>: The JDBC database driver as specified by JDBC vendor.
	     <br/>
	     Examples: <code>oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver</code>, <code>org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver</code>.
	     <!-- <br/><br/> -->
	     </li>

	     <li><b><code>SQLTags.connectionUrl</code></b>:  The JDBC connection URL as specified by JDBC vendor.
	     <br/>
	     Examples: <code>jdbc:mysql://localhost/scott?user=root</code>, <code>jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:ORCL</code>.
	     <!-- <br/><br/> -->
	     </li>

	     <li><b><code>SQLTags.maxPoolSize</code></b>:  Maximum number of JDBC connections for the connection pool.
	     <!-- <br/><br/> -->
	     </li>

	     <li><b><code>SQLTags.poolSize</code></b>:  Default size of the JDBC connection pool.
	     <!-- <br/><br/> -->
	     </li>

	     <li><b><code>SQLTags.userName</code></b>:  Database user for JDBC connections.
	     <!-- <br/><br/> -->
	     </li>

	     <li><b><code>SQLTags.password</code></b>:  Database user's password.
	     <!-- <br/><br/> -->
	     </li>
     </ul>

     <h3>Authoring JSP Pages with SQLTags</h3>

     <p>
     SQLTags development starts with a well-defined data model.
     So, for the purposes of this article, I will refer to the "classic" EMP-DEPT data model that was shown above in Figure 1.
     </p>

	<h4>Sample 1. Listing all EMP data with related DEPT name.</h4>

     <p>
	In this first example,
	I will demonstrate a simple JSP page that displays a listing of all rows from the EMP table and their assigned DEPT.  
     </p>

<pre><code>&lt;%@ taglib uri="demoTags.jar" prefix="sqltags" %&gt;
&lt;%@ taglib uri="http://java.sun.com/jstl/core"
    prefix="c" %&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;JSP Page&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;%-- uses configuration from web.xml.  --%&gt;
&lt;sqltags:connection id="connect" &gt;
   &lt;sqltags:emp id="e" where="order by ename"&gt;
        &lt;c:out value="${e.ENAME}"/&gt; assigned to 
        &lt;c:out value="${e.FK_DEPTNO.DNAME}"/&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
   &lt;/sqltags:emp&gt;
&lt;/sqltags:connection&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

     <p>
     The first two lines introduce the two tag libraries used within the JSP page.
     The <code>&lt;sqltags:connection&gt;</code> tag is used to access the JDBC connection pool which must wrap all of the other SQLTags tags.
     The next line introduces the EMP tag and defines a "where clause" that matches all rows and orders the results by ENAME.
     The JSTL &lt;c:out&gt; tags are used to output the <code>ENAME</code> property from the <code>EMP</code> JavaBean
     (<code>ENAME</code> is a column from the <code>EMP</code> table).
     Finally, the <code>DNAME</code> property from the related <code>DEPT</code> table is output for each <code>EMP</code> in the table.
     </p>

     <p>Viewing the above page from the browser would yield the output shown in Figure 2, provided we have suitable data in the database:
     </p>

     <p><img src="output1.jpg" /><br />
        <i>Figure 2. Sample Output: single table query</i>
     </p>

     <h4>Sample 2. Parent-Child nesting of EMP within DEPT.</h4>

     <p>In the second example,
     I will demonstrate a simple JSP page that implements the parent-child configuration listing EMPs within each DEPT.
     </p>

<pre><code>&lt;%@ taglib uri="demoTags.jar" prefix="sqltags" %&gt;

     Again,
     the first two lines introduce the two tag libraries used within the JSP page.
     The <code>&lt;sqltags:connection&gt;</code> tag is used to access the JDBC connection pool, and must wrap all of the other SQLTags tags.
     The <code>DEPT</code> tag defines a "where clause" that matches all rows and orders the results by DNAME.
     The next line outputs the department name (<code>DNAME</code>)
     and the <code>blockquote</code> provides a visual indentation showing employees that belong to each department.
     The <code>EMP</code> tag provides the mechanism to nest the employees within the related <code>DEPT</code>. 
     The <code>foreignKey</code> attribute tells the <code>EMP</code> tag
     which foreign to use to reference (join to) the <code>DEPT</code> tag
     and the <code>parentName</code> attribute identifies which <code>DEPT</code> tag instance should be referenced.
     The next line simply outputs each employee name one per line.

     <h3>Summary and Preview of Advanced Topics</h3>

<!-- co: you sort of go from "there's a lot more functionality", to a sell
    of why SQLTags are useful, back to the advanced functionality.  I moved
    the advanced stuff up to join the "scratch the surface" text, and let
    this close with the sell.  ca -->
     <p>
     I've just scratched the surface of what is possible with SQLTags.
     There is a lot more functionality available within the tool set, including:</p>
     <ul>
	     <li> multi-row insert, update, and delete in HTML</li>
	     <li> Application Server deployment</li>
	     <li> using <code>DataSources</code></li>
	     <li> using authentication and access control with <code>allow</code>, <code>deny</code>, and <code>auth</code> tags</li>
	     <li> using "handler" classes to easily deal with <code>BLOB</code> and <code>CLOB</code> column types, paging of results, etc.</li>
     </ul>


     
     <p>Hopefully, you've seen enough to whet your interest to investigate further.
     MVC is a also great design pattern,
     but SQLTags can be successfully employed when used to develop a data-driven web application
     that closely follows a well defined data model with limited processing logic.
     </p>

     <p>
     Basically, for data-in, data-out applications, SQLTags is just the ticket.
